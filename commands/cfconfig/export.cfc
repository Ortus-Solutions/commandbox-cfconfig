/**
* Export configuration from a server.  If you don't specify a to, we look for a CommandBox server using the current working
* directory.  Only rely on this if you have a single CommandBox server running in the current directory.  
* 
* {code:bash}
* cfconfig export myConfig.json
* cfconfig export serverNameToExportTo
* cfconfig export to=/path/to/server/home/to/export/to
* {code}
* 
* When specifying the direct path to the server home, here are the rules based on the engine you're using:
* For Lucee's web context, point to the folder containing the lucee-web.xml.cfm file.
* Ex: <webroot>/WEB-INF/lucee
* 
* For Lucee's server context, point to be the "lucee-server" folder containing the /context/lucee-server.xml file.
* Ex: /opt/lucee/lib/lucee-server
*
* For Adobe servers, point to the "cfusion" folder containing the lib/neo-runtime.xml file.
* Ex: C:/ColdFusion11/cfusion
*   
* For CommandBox servers, we'll get the engine/version out of CommandBox's metadata.  For non-CommandBox servers, you'll need to help me out by
* specifying what kind of file format to use.
* 
* For the fromFormat and toFormat, use the name of the engine followed by @ and then the engine version like engine@version.  
* For lucee, specify the web or sever context.  Valid engines are "luceeWeb", "luceeServer", and "adobe".  
* For partial versions, the missing pieces will be interpreted as zeros.  Meaning adobe@11 is the same as adobe@11.0.0.
* Examples are:
* - adobe@11.0.11
* - luceeWeb@5
* - luceeServer@4.5
* 
* {code:bash}
* cfconfig export to=/path/to/.CFConfig.json from=/path/to/server/home fromFormat=luceeServer@5.1
* {code}
* 
* The version number can be left off toFormat and fromFormat when reading or writing to a CFConfig JSON file or a CommandBox server since we already know the version.
* If you don't specify a Lucee web or Server context, we default to server. Use a format of "luceeWeb" to switch.
* 
* You can customize what config settings are transferred with the includeList and excludeList params.  If at least one include pattern is provided, ONLY matching 
* settings will be included.  Nested keys such as datasources.myDSN or mailservers[1] can be used.  You may also use basic wildcards in your pattern.  A single *
* will match any number of chars inside a key name.  A double ** will match any number of nested keys.
* 
* {code:bash}
* # Include all settings startingw with "event"
* cfconfig export to=.CFConfig.json includeList=event*
* # Exclude all keys called "password" regardless of what struct they are in
* cfconfig export to=.CFConfig.json excludeList=**.password
* {code}
* 
* Use the append parameter to merge incomning data with any data already present.  For example, if a server already has one datasource defined and you import
* a JSON file with 2 more unique datasources, the --apend flag will not remove the pre-existing one.
* 
* {code:bash}
* cfconfig export to=.CFConfig.json includeList=datasources --append
* {code}
* 
* If you usually replace sensitive or volatile information in a JSON export with env var expansions like ${DB_PASSWORD}, you can do this automatically my supplying one or more
* replace mappings.  The key is a regular expression to match a key in the format of "datasources.myDSN.password" and the value is the name of the env var to use.
* The values will be written to a .env file in the current working directory.  You can override this path with the "dotenvFile" param, or pass an empty string to disable it from being written.
* 
* {code:bash}
* cfconfig export to=.CFConfig.json replace:datasources\.myDSN\.password=DB_PASSWORD
* {code}
* 
* As the value is a regular expression, you can use backreferences like \1 in your env var to make them dynamic.  
* This example would create env vars such as DB_MYDSN_PASSWORD where MYDSN is your actual datasource name.
*
* {code:bash}
* cfconfig export to=.CFConfig.json replace:replace:datasources\.(.*)\.password=DB_\1_PASSWORD
* {code}
* 
* 
* Any valid regex is possible for some clever replacements.  This examplew would create env vars such as DB_MYDSN_PORT, DB_MYDSN_HOST, and DB_MDSN_DATABASE
*
* {code:bash}
* cfconfig export to=.CFConfig.json replace:datasources\.(.*)\.(password|class|port|host|database)=DB_\1_\2 dotenvFile=../../settings.properties
* {code}
*
* To avoid having to pass these replacements every time you transfer your config, you can set then as a global setting for the commandbox-cfconfig module.
*
* {code:bash}
* # Replace all mail server passwords with ${MAIL_PASSWORD}
* config set modules.commandbox-cfconfig.JSONExpansions[mailServers.*.password]=MAIL_PASSWORD
* # Dynamically replace with ${DB_MYDSN_password}, ${DB_MYDSN_CLASS}, ${DB_MYDSN_PORT}, etc
* config set modules.commandbox-cfconfig.JSONExpansions[datasources\.(.*)\.(password|class|port|host|database)]=DB_\1_\2
* # Use default env var name for all settings starting with "requestTimeout" and replace with ${REQUEST_TIMEOUT} and ${REQUEST_TIMEOUT_ENABLED}
* config set modules.commandbox-cfconfig.JSONExpansions[requestTimeout.*]=
* {code}
*
